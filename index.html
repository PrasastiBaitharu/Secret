        <p>
            Distance has taught me many things, but the most important one is how deeply U care about me.
            Even miles apart, you are always close to my heart.
        </p>

        <p>
            I don’t have expensive gifts, but I have feelings that are real, honest,
            and meant only for you.
        </p>

        <p>
            Today, on Propose Day, I choose you — through the distance,
            the waiting, and the future we’ll build together.
        </p>
